    - work with latest Mouse (hdp)

	~ unify module version numbers with dist version (hdp)

0.16 Tue. February 17 2009
	* t/
		- run pod tests only if RELEASE_TESTING env var is set

0.15 Sat. July 26 2008
	* MouseX::Getopt::OptionTypeMap
	  - Accept type constraint objects in the type mapping, not just names

0.14 Thurs. July 10, 2008
	* MouseX::Getopt::OptionTypeMap
	  - Change 'Float' which doesn't exist to 'Num' which does (perigrin)
	 
	* MouseX::Getopt
	  - removed the default handling with Getopt::Long::Descriptive

	    bad. Besides, Mouse will just DWIM on this anyway. (stevan)
	    - added test for it (stevan)

    * t/
      - fixed Getopt::Long::Descriptive specific tests to only run 
        if Getopt::Long::Descriptive is there (stevan)
